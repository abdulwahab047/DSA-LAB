Function Overloading & Pointers
Returning values in different ways (by value, reference, and pointer).
Using pointers to manipulate stack elements dynamically.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Encapsulation: The Stack class hides implementation details while exposing necessary operations.
Constructor & Destructor: Managing object creation and cleanup (Stack() and ~Stack()).
Access Specifiers: Keeping top and items[] private while providing public methods.

Stack Data Structure Implementation
Push & Pop operations: Adding and removing elements from the stack.
Peek function: Retrieving the top element without removing it.
Stack overflow & underflow handling: Preventing errors when the stack is full or empty.
String reversal using stack: Demonstrates a real-world application of stacks.

Memory Management
Using automatic memory allocation with an array-based stack (char items[MAX_ITEMS]).
Destructor for cleanup (~Stack()).
