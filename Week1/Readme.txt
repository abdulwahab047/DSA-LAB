Function Overloading & Pointers

Different ways to return values (by value, reference, and pointer).
The use of pointers to modify external variables.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Constructor overloading for flexibility.
Operator overloading to simplify complex operations.
Memory management (new and delete) for dynamic objects.
Templates and Generic Programming

Function templates allow generic algorithms to work with multiple data types.
Class templates enable reusable and flexible data structures.
Encapsulation and Data Abstraction

Using classes to encapsulate behavior (Complex, myPair, mySequence).
Hiding implementation details while exposing essential functionalities.
